## Overview
I am dmoroch7. Join me in this adventure which is my first project focused on learning and recording all steps of my journey to master bash scripting.

This project is designed to solve all levels of BANDIT coming from the webpage (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). 
The goal of this project is to provide solutions to each level of the Bandit challenge. 
It also serves as a learning resource for me and beginners who want to understand the process of solving the challenges and improve their knowledge of system administration, security, and scripting.

## How It Works

Each level of Bandit introduces a new challenge that requires using specific Linux tools and techniques to navigate a simulated system and get a key for the next level. 
This project will contain scripts and all extra paths I took to found each level keys, providing my point of view into the problem-solving process.

### Structure

- **Level Solutions**: Each level will have a file containing the solution script and a explanation of how the challenge was solved.
- **Tools Used**:  The description of tools and commands used like; `ssh`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `awk`, `nano`.
- **Security Insights**:  Privilege escalation, file permissions, ports, protocol, etc.
